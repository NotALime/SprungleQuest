    - You like wizards? I sure hope you don't, my little brother was kidnapped by
      the one living not far from here.
    - If you wanna do this town a favor, go slay that darn wizard, he lives not far
      from here.
    - I hate wizards so much, the one that lives near here stole my sheep, poor thing
      came back 3 days later with it's skin flipped inside out, including the wool.
