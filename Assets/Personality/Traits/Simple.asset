    - I'm a simple person... lived here all my life, and I hope to keep that streak.
    - You're an adventurer..? Yeah sorry it's just that I'm not into being a broke
      homeless vagrant who risks my his own life for the tiniest possibility of treasure
      on the daily. I'm just not about that kind of life.
    - We don't want none of you adventurers around here.
    - I wouldn't serve adventurers if I could, but money is money...
    - Today's youth cannot fathom the satisfaction of a hard day's work, all they
      know is adventure, sword-fighting, and peddler's pickle
