    - My goodness! You saved me from those evil cultists! They were trying to bind
      my soul to a steed's!
    - Neigh! Oh... uh... sorry, the horse's soul must've merged with mine to a certain
      extent...
    - Thank you brave adventurer! Without you, my brittle bones would have never
      escaped the grips of them!
    - Man, I am really craving some apples right now.
    - I'm so hungry I could eat a horse... is what I would have said if a horse wasn't
      gnawing away at my soul right now.
    - Those cultists did a number on my psyche... I think the horse's soul is inside
      me... I can still hear it...
