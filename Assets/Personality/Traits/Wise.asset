  combatLines:
  - 'A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool. '
  - A wise man knows he knows nothing, a fool thinks he knows everything.
  - Wise men don't need advice. Fools won't take it.
  - A fool flatters himself, a wise man flatters the fool.
  - A wise man gets more use from his enemies than a fool from his friends.
  - Wise men learn by others' harms, fools by their own.
