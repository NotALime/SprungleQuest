    - Sometimes I think to myself, "man, magic is so cool". And then I remember what
      the mages did to us.
    - I heard the village over the mountain got a wizard, living as if he was a regular
      dweller, terrible how far our society has fallen...
    - I hate wizards so much, it's not even funny.
    - First your kid wants to go adventuring, then he finds some magic wand, then
      some hermit wizard offers him some peddler's pickles... Next thing you know,
      he's studying the arcane arts! It's a pipeline, I pipeline I tell you!
    - Nobody tells you that mages are only good at magic because they're severely
      inbred... I'd be magical too if my family tree was a circle...

    - Oh yeah? And I bet you're a wizard!
