    - 'This village has had a dragon problem, one of them darn reptiles decided to
      build a nest nearby, can''t go on a leisurely walk in the woods without getting
      incinerated anymore... '
    - I always thought dragons were cool, but now that one settled by our village,
      I understand why they are classified as vermin.
    - If you want a real challenge, try slaying the dragon that lives nearby, he
      has been harassing us villagefolk for weeks now.
